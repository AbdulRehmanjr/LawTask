        <p>
          LawTasks.pro respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. Each user is
          responsible for ensuring that the materials they upload to the LawTasks.pro website and related applications
          and services (collectively, the “LawTasks Service”) do not infringe any third--party copyright.
          We will promptly remove materials from the LawTasks Service in accordance with the Digital Millennium
          Copyright Act (“DMCA”) if properly notified that the materials infringe a third party's copyright. In
          addition, we may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of repeat copyright infringers.

          Please note that we will send any complete counter-notifications we receive to the person who submitted the original DMCA notice.

If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten (10) business days after we provide notice of your counter-notification, we will restore the removed materials.
